  <h4>This homemade jalapeño poppers recipe was made by taking the best features of three or four other popper recipes
    and combining them to make something that tastes wonderful. A frequent request at my house, and at others. I usually
    make 100 and put them in the fridge. They don't last long so increase the recipe as necessary. Adjust the amount of
    bacon bits and type of shredded cheese to taste. Lots of tests will help you figure out the best way you like your
    jalapeño poppers.</h3>

    <h2>How to Make Jalapeño Poppers</h2>
    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you
      make these homemade jalapeño poppers:</p>

    <h3>Seed and Half the Jalapeños</h3>
    <p>Wear food-grade gloves to avoid burning your hands while removing the jalapeño seeds. Slice the jalapeño in half
      lengthwise with a paring knife, then use the knife to cut away the seeds and ribs.</p>

    <h3>Fill the Jalapeños</h3>
    <p>Make the filling by mixing softened cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and bacon bits. Spoon the mixture into jalapeño
      halves.</p>

    <h3>Dredge the Jalapeños</h3>
    <p>Dip the jalapeños in milk, then dip them in flour. Let them dry for about 10 minutes, then dip them in milk
      again. Roll the wet jalapeños in bread crumbs until they're well-coated. Let them dry, then repeat the milk-crumb
      process once more. Allow the peppers to dry completely.</p>

    <h3>Fry and Drain the Jalapeños</h3>
    <p>Heat oil to 365 degrees F in a skillet. Working in batches, fry the jalapeño poppers until they're golden brown.
      Drain on paper towels.</p>

    <h2>How Long to Cook Jalapeños Poppers</h2>
    <p>When fried at 365 degrees F, these homemade jalapeño poppers should be beautifully golden brown and crunchy in
      about two to three minutes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 ounce cream cheese, softned</li>
      <li>1 (ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon bacon bits</li>
      <li>12 ounce jalapeño peppers, seeded and halved</li>
      <li>1 cup of milk</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 quarts oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>

        plate; let dry for 10 minutes.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Dip jalapeños in milk once more, then roll through the bread crumbs. Let dry on the plate for 10 minutes, then
        repeat dipping in milk and rolling in bread crumbs once more; make sure they are completely coated. Let dry.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Heat oil to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C) in a medium skillet.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Working in batches if necessary, deep-fry coated jalapeños until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and let
        drain on a paper towel.</li>
